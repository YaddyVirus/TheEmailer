Quick and dirty email automation to beat an attendance system

The person incharge of keeping record of attendance in my company has a huge ego and told me to email my attendance to him inspite of tagging myself on the RFID only because I am an intern (can't really seem to find any other reason for it other than his ego)

Anyways, I decided to solve the problem today and therefore am writing this script to send an automated email to that guy (based on where I have to go according to my company schedule) at a predefined time and notify my by text message that the email has been sent. No more iterative emails anymore.

I have used a bunch of dependencies in this project, most notable being Scheduler, SMTPlib, datetime, time and Twilio for text message confirmation.
